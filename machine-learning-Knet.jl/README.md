## ðŸ“„ Got to know [Knet.jl](https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl) + Course Review ðŸ“„

## Deliverable

We were asked to complete [this](https://juliaacademy.com/p/the-world-of-machine-learning-with-knet) course and pass it's final exam and write a comprehensive review.

I learnt about cool things like Q/A from a Artificial Brain and the Image Recognition along with the working behing them.

 I also built my own Language Model to produce prose (after training on all works of Shakespeare) of *legit* quality. Better than some modern day writers no offense..

For this task, you will just be doing a lot of Learning!

- Sign up for JuliaAcademy

- Upload a screenshot here of your completed course
- Upload feedback about the course to [this thread.](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/JuliaAcademyMaterials/issues/25) Note that the comments do not need to be all positive. We are looking for feedback to improve the experience for students learning Julia!

**PLEASE DO NOT COPY OTHER STUDENTS WORK!**

Note that feedback on topics like Machine Learning is especially valuable given that the topic itself is inherently difficult. This means that just saying you agree with what everyone else said is not considered quality feedback.

Also note that for the feedback, you should provide 2-3 specific pieces of feedback that we can use to improve the course. This means that just saying you agree with what everyone else said is not considered quality feedback. Feedback must be original and not already cited by other students.
