## Implement an exercise for the Julia Exercism Track

### Task description

[Exercism](https://exercism.io/) is a free mentoring and learning platform that features a Julia track.

Pick an [unimplemented exercise](https://tracks.exercism.io/julia/master/unimplemented) and implement it in Julia according to the contributing docs (note: here, "student" refers to a student solving the exercises on the site, not students in the Code-in sense).

**Please make sure to open an issue or draft pull request in the repo to let others know which exercise you are working on! Also check if others are already working on an exercise you want to implement.**

Example implementations in dozens of other languages, such as Python, Java, TypeScript, Go or C# are available and can be used as baseline for the Julia implementation.

The task difficulty varies wildly depending on the exercise you choose. Some are suitable for beginners, others require more advanced programming skills.

You may also choose to implement a generator that turns the common exercise test data (JSON) into an idiomatic Julia test suite. This is completely optional but can be an interesting challenge. (Done by @soumitradev)
