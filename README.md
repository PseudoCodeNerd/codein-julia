# :gear: Google Code-In 2019 | Julia Programming Language

This repository includes sources to all the tasks I worked on (whether claimed or not) during Google Code-In.

Some tasks contains READMEs with links to PR(s) / Issues while other contain code / design / documentation files.
This will support the blog I write on my experience in GCI this year.

> Julia, you were great !

EDIT: Ok so I became a Finalist. If it weren't for my ACT and the malaria attack I suffered from during the course of GCI, maybe I could have pushed to a Runner-Up. 
Nevertheless, WooHoo. I get a jacket. nice.
