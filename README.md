# :gear:Google Code-In 2019 | Julia Programming Language

This repository includes sources to all the tasks I worked on (whether claimed or not) during Google Code-In.

Some tasks contains READMEs with links to PR(s) / Issues while other contain code / design / documentation files.
This will support the blog I write on my experience in GCI this year.

> Julia, you were great !
