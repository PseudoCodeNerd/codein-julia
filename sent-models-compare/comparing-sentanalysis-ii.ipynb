Compare it with models in ScikitLearn and Spacy python libraries. Upload your results as an issue in the TextAnalysis package.\n\nSome basic machine learning knowledge is useful for this task.\n\n### Special thanks to Ayush Kaushal; an exemplary mentor without whom this task wouldn't be possible.\n\nFind below, the `julia` part of the task. The python notebook would be attached too but would have sparse documentation.\n\n> The process of algorithmically identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in text to determine the userâ€™s attitude toward the subject of the document (or post).\n\nThis is how I understand it.\n\nThis would be done using a simple one layer neural network.
