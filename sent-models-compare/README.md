## Compare SentimentAnalysis models

### Task Description

Use the[ amazon review data](https://www.kaggle.com/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews) from Kaggle to test the efficiency of our Sentiment Analysis models that live in [TextAnalysis.jl](https://github.com/JuliaText/TextAnalysis.jl). Compare it with models in ScikitLearn and Spacy python libraries. Upload your results as an issue in the TextAnalysis package.

Some basic machine learning knowledge is useful for this task.
