## Create a sample dashboard with Dashboards.jl 

### Task Description

[Dashboards.jl](https://github.com/waralex/Dashboards.jl) is a new set of Julia bindings to Plotly's Dash. Try creating an interactive dashboard and make a PR adding it to the repo of examples.

The Dash (python) [user guide](https://dash.plot.ly/) is a good place to start. A set of examples using plotly-python is available [here](https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps). You can choose to implement an example from there or create a new and independent example using novel data.

Examples of Julia Dashboard use are in this repo: https://github.com/waralex/DashboardsExamples. Do not implement any example that already exists in this repo.

Please do not copy an existing example. You should be creating an original example in Julia.
