## Judge books by their cover using Flux.jl

### Task Description

#### Create a machine learning model to predict the category of a book from its cover image

This task is inspired by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09204). Your task is to use the Flux machine learning library to predict the category of books in [this dataset](https://github.com/uchidalab/book-dataset) based on their cover images.

You can find the Flux documentation [here](https://fluxml.ai/) and sample models for image categorization in the model zoo. We recommend starting with a simple model like [this](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/blob/master/vision/mnist/mlp.jl) one and then optionally using a more complex one if you are interested.


P.S: I made a complex model and was able to near the accuracy put forward in the original paper . Dope
