### [The Quiz .pdf](./Basics_of_Linear_Algebra_-_Quiz.pdf)

I created a quiz on **Basics of Linear Algebra** lectures in the Introduction to Julia Course.

The course had lectures on how to do Linear Algebra with Julia (it's really simple with Julia üòÑ).

It was under **Advanced Julia Topics** and my quiz is being used as a test to check lecture understanding of the students as an official after lecture test.


I tried my best to adhere to the [official JuliaLang Color Scheme](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia-logo-graphics) and the end result came out to be pretty nice-looking (+typography too..)
