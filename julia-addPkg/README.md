## Download Julia and add a package to an environment

### Task description

Julia allows for making isolated and reproducible "environments". This can be done in multiple ways, from within the REPL, and as a command line flag. Download the latest stable Julia and activate a new environment called "myenv" and add a package to it. You can find some documentation here.

**Submit a screenshot of the complete output of the ]st commad in your environment. It should clearly show the name of the environment and the call to start Julia.**
