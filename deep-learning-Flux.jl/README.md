## üìÑ Deep Learning Course + Review üìÑ

## Deliverable

We were asked to complete [this](https://juliaacademy.com/p/deep-learning-with-flux-jl) course and pass it's final exam and write a comprehensive review.

I wanted to learn more about doing Deep Learning in the Julia Ecosystem and this course really helped me to clear my concepts and start my journey in **DL/ML with Julia.**

1. [My Course Review](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/JuliaAcademyMaterials/issues/26#issuecomment-570552775)
2. Cool **DL** Project coming up soon... ‚è≥ (Not Required for Course Completion)

## Complete the Deep Learning with Flux.jl course on JuliaAcademy.org

For this task, you will just be doing a lot of Learning!

- Sign up for JuliaAcademy
- Take the Deep Learning with Flux course and finish it 100%.
- Upload a screenshot here of your completed course
- Upload feedback about the course to [this thread.](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/JuliaAcademyMaterials/issues/26) Note that the comments do not need to be all positive. We are looking for feedback to improve the experience for students learning Julia!

**PLEASE DO NOT COPY OTHER STUDENTS WORK!**

Note that feedback on topics like Machine Learning is especially valuable given that the topic itself is inherently difficult. This means that just saying you agree with what everyone else said is not considered quality feedback.

Also note that for the feedback, you should provide 2-3 specific pieces of feedback that we can use to improve the course. This means that just saying you agree with what everyone else said is not considered quality feedback. Feedback must be original and not already cited by other students.
