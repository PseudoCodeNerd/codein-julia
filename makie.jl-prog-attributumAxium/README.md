## Create a Makie.jl program utilizing as many attributes as possible.

Some of the[ docs for Makie.jl](http://makie.juliaplots.org/dev/) reference [attributes](http://makie.juliaplots.org/dev/) that you can use. However, the actual usage of those attributes may not be clear to some people.

**Create an example Makie.jl program and corresponding blog post/GitHub gist(or just comments in the code) that explain the code and utilizes as many possible different parts of Makie as possible.** The overarching goal is to show how to reference and use as many attributes as possible available in Makie.jl.
