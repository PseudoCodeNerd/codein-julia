## Document and Training Text for Machine Learning Models

### Task description

The [Flux.jl model-zoo](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo) has a bunch of machine learning models present in it that show usage of some of the capabilities of the package. Not all of them have literature to follow with them to help a beginner with the process of figuring out what is going on and why.

*Take one such model and add this description in plain English in the appropriate places in a manner amenable to Literate.jl.* 

Flux.jl uses Literate.jl to add information about the models in the zoo, to make it easy to convert from a script to a jupyter notebook, and be shipped to a website.

- Setup the dev environment for working with Flux and its model zoo.
- Learn the fundamentals of the models you‚Äôre interested in working on (hint: take cues from already existing ones in the zoo)
- Write out clear and actionable descriptions of the steps taken in the models
