## Deliverable

1. [Scene Notebook](./scene.ipynb)
   
The scene is inspired from a drawing which I drew while in 4th grade. I was never the painter and my scenes always sucked in class. *This is my attempt to draw the same using code and to show my friends I can draw without picking up a brush, like a geek.*

The scene in itself is fairly simple. There's a cool sky, some fresh green grass and a road running in front of a 2-d house. The house has a pool in front of it and it's always sunny here in this world. The residents of this house express their love for the Julia Programming Language by painting a logo of the scientific programming lannguage on the front wall of their house.

## Draw a scene using Cario.jl/Luxor.jl# 30sCode-beginner

### Task description

It's what it says in the title! Write a script that draws a scene using either Cairo.jl or Luxor.jl. The scene can be anything that is beyond a reasonable difficulty. Explain the code as best as you can. It can include mountains or the beach, it can be a self portrait, or even the Mona Lisa, if you are feeling a tad adventurous! Go crazy! **Just don't copy other people's work**
