### [The Quiz .pdf](./EndOfCourse_Quiz.pdf) (under MIT License)

I created the **End Of Course Quiz** for the World of Machine Learning with Knet course.

The course was really advanced with lectures ranging from Visual Question and Answering, Image Recognition and Language Models.

It provided very little theory, thus limiting the number of *good* questions. The course was **heavy on implementation** but still some questions **have been** made to test the students‚Äô knowledge gathered from all the videos.

I tried my best to adhere to the [official JuliaLang Color Scheme](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia-logo-graphics) and the end result came out to be pretty nice-looking (+typography too..)

## Design a quiz for the Introduction to Julia course on JuliaAcademy.com

*This task is designed for students who have completed the task titled: "Complete the "World of Machine Learning with Knet" course on JuliaAcademy.com"*

Create a simple 7-10 question multiple-choice quiz (it can have less than 7-10 questions if the video is short). Each question should have 4 choices.

Topics must be picked from the below list:
